## AI Use
Almost all of this code was written by the group members, where we used AI (ChatGPT) to help debug our code when we encountered a error. Everytime we used ChatGPT to fix a function we made a comment next to the line it corrected. We also used ChatGPT to help understand the functions in the rwlocks which come from / modify the code found here: https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-code/blob/master/threads-sema/rwlock.c
